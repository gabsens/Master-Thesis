# Master-Thesis

This repository contains the report for my master's research internship in Optimal Transport.

It starts with a self-contained introduction to optimal transport, so that the reader is equipped with enough knowledge to understand the rest. It is followed by an exposition of the internship's research topics: tree metrics, the algorithmic complexity of Sinkhorn's algorithm and the statistical properties of optimal transport.

The internship was supervised by [Marco Cuturi](http://marcocuturi.net/) and [Victor-Emmanuel Brunel](https://vebrunel.com/about/).

Final grade: 18/20
